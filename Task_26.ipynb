        "*   Optimizers are algorithms that adjust the weights and biases of a neural network during training to minimize the loss function.\n",
        "*   Different optimizers, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc., have different update rules and convergence properties.\n",
        "*   Optimizers use gradients computed during backpropagation to update the model's parameters.\n",
        "*   Learning rate, momentum, and other hyperparameters can be tuned to improve optimizer performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Last-layer Activations:**\n",
        "*   The activation function applied to the last layer of a neural network determines the output format and the type of problem the model can solve.\n",
        "*   For binary classification problems, sigmoid activation (e.g., sigmoid function) is commonly used to obtain a probability output between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   For multi-class classification problems, softmax activation is used to obtain a probability distribution over multiple classes.\n",
        "*   For regression tasks, linear activation or a suitable activation function based on the output range can be used.\n",
        "# **Loss Functions:**\n",
        "*   Loss functions quantify the model's performance by measuring the difference between predicted outputs and the true labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Different loss functions are used depending on the task at hand, such as    binary cross-entropy for binary classification, categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification, mean squared error for regression, etc.\n",
        "*   The choice of loss function depends on the problem, output format, and activation function used in the last layer.\n",
        "# **Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
        "*   Evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of a trained model on a validation or test dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error, etc.\n",
        "*   The choice of evaluation metric depends on the problem and the desired performance measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   It is important to consider the context and requirements of the specific task when selecting an evaluation metric.\n",
